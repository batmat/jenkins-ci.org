As you hopefully have already heard, the first [Jenkins User Conference (JUC)](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011.cb) will be held on Sunday, October 2nd (the day before JavaOne starts), at the Marine Memorial Club Hotel in San Francisco. If you haven't signed up to go yet, you definitely should do that, but you should also think about giving a talk!

But I'm not qualified to give a talk - I'm not a Jenkins developer!" you may think. Not true! This conference is first and foremost for Jenkins *users*, so your experiences, impressions, thoughts, best practices, etc with Jenkins all provide vital fuel for interesting and helpful talks. Do you have a Jenkins workflow you're particularly proud of? Or have you had some less than positive experiences trying to do certain things, giving you a good sense of lessons learned and what *not* to do? Are you integrating Jenkins with other tools in new and interesting ways? Have you come up with a fun new use of Jenkins at your office? Well, then, you've got the material for a great talk right there.

The deadline for talk submissions is September 1, so you've still got plenty of time to [put together an abstract and send it in](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011.cb). It'll be a great opportunity to share your knowledge and experience with other users of Jenkins. Also, every speaker gets a signed picture of Kohsuke!

...ok, I just made up the signed picture. But I bet Kohsuke will do it anyway!
