This post is about plugging Perl tests in a Hudson instance. It was originally posted on <a href="http://damien.krotkine.com/the-player-of-games/2009/11/produce-junit-output-from-perl-tests.html">my blog</a><br>

Perl has a strong testing culture. A lot of helpers are available to assit in writing, running, analyzing smoke tests, unit tests, feature tests, automatic documentation coverage, etc. I was interested into plugging a full Perl test suite into a running Hudson server, used to monitor other in-house projects.<br>
<br>
The Perl test suite was using TAP, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol"> Test Anything Protocol</a>, and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a>, two very commonly used pieces of software when writing Perl tests.<br>
<br>
