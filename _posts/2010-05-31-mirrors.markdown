 * **[mirrors.xmission.com/jenkins](http://mirrors.xmission.com/jenkins)** - [XMission, Inc.](http://www.xmission.com) - (*US West*)
 * **[mirrors.esast.com](http://mirrors.esast.com)** [Esast](http://www.esast.com) - (*Taiwan, Southeast Asia*)




### Running a mirror

More mirrors are certainly welcome, Jenkins is primarily mirrored by the [Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)](http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/details). Both the hudson-labs and OSUOSL servers are primarily located within the United States, so international (Japan/UK/Germany) mirrors would be greatly appreciated.


If you're interested in running a public mirror, drop an email to "tyler@linux.com" and we can discuss space and bandwidth requirements.
